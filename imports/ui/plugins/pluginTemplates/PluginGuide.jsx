<p>Each of your libraries can have its own plugin stack. Use both community and local plugins to create a stack which processes your files to your requirements.</p>

<p>Plugins created in the plugin creator will be saved locally in 'Tdarr/Plugins/Local' and can be viewed on the 'Local' plugins tab to the upper left.</p>

<br/>
<br/>

<p><b>Place 'Filter' plugins at the top of your library plugin stack.</b> Files will be sent through filter plugins first to determine whether they should be processed or not.</p>


<br/>
<br/>
<p>When using Tdarr it's important that you implement conditions to prevent your files from going through an infinite transcode/remux cycle. For example, if you're transcoding into hevc then add a filter to prevent hevc being transcoded. That way your new files (in hevc), won't be re-transcoded.</p>
